# Sales Forecasting

This project builds a machine learning solution to forecast future sales using the **Walmart Sales Forecast dataset** from Kaggle. The workflow leverages historical sales data, time-based features, and regression models to predict sales for upcoming periods.

## Features

* **Data Preparation**: Loaded and cleaned historical sales data.
* **Feature Engineering**: Created time-based features such as day, month, and lag values.
* **Model Training**: Applied Linear regression and XGB Regression models to forecast sales trends.
* **Evaluation**: Assessed prediction accuracy with error metrics.
* **Visualization**: Plotted actual versus predicted sales values over time.

## Getting Started

1. Place the dataset `Walmart_Sales_Forecast.csv` in your working directory.
2. Run the notebook or Python script to:

   * Process and prepare the data.
   * Generate time-based features.
   * Train regression models.
   * Forecast future sales.
   * Visualize the results.

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* XG BOOST

## Results

* Forecasts capture sales patterns and trends based on historical data.
* Time-based features improve predictive performance.
* Plots highlight alignment between actual and forecasted sales over time.
