# Loan Approval Prediction

This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved, using the **Loan Approval Prediction dataset** from Kaggle. The workflow emphasizes data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and evaluating classification performance with appropriate metrics.

## Features

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
* **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyzed distributions of applicant attributes and approval outcomes.
* **Model Training**: Built a random forest model to predict loan approval status.
* **Imbalance Handling**: Applied techniques to address class imbalance and improve reliability.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Focused on Precision, Recall, and F1-score to assess predictive performance.
* **Visualization**: Compared predicted versus actual approvals with plots for interpretability.

## Getting Started

1. Place the dataset `Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset.csv` in your working directory.
2. Run the notebook or Python script to:

   * Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   * Train classification models.
   * Evaluate performance with imbalanced data considerations.
   * Visualize the results.

## Results

* The random forest model predicts loan approval decisions with reasonable accuracy.
* Precision, Recall, and F1-score provide a balanced evaluation on imbalanced data.
* Visualizations highlight differences between predicted and actual loan approval outcomes.
