# **Student Score Prediction**

This project builds a predictive model to estimate students' exam scores based on study hours, using the Student Performance Factors dataset from Kaggle. The workflow includes data cleaning, visualization, linear regression modeling, and evaluation of prediction performance.

✨ **Features**

Data Cleaning & Exploration 📂: Handled missing values and performed descriptive statistics.

Visualization 📊: Scatter plots and summary charts to understand the relationship between study hours and exam scores.

Train-Test Split ✂️: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training 🤖: Applied Linear Regression to predict exam scores from study hours.

Evaluation Metrics 📏: Calculated MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to measure accuracy.

Prediction Visualization 🎨: Compared actual vs predicted exam scores with scatter plots.

**🚀 Getting Started**

Place the dataset StudentPerformanceFactors.csv in your working directory.

Run the notebook or Python script to:

Load and clean the dataset.

Train the linear regression model.

Generate predictions.

View performance metrics and plots.

**📊 Results**

The model successfully predicts students’ exam scores from study hours.

Evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) provide insight into accuracy.

Visualization clearly shows the relationship between study time and predicted performance.
